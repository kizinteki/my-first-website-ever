<h2> This is my first website ever. </h2>
<p> I'm learning, trying and doing different kinds of things. "A river cuts through rock not because of its power, but because of its persistence.
Nowadays, I'm trying to learn CSS foundations. And this is just a basic website that I've ever done. <br> <br> 

But a big step for me, small step for humanity. Hope you'll enjoy it.  </p>
